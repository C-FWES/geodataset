# Google Streetview Dataset Generation

## About

This python script generates a dataset of random streetview locations from the following countries:

* Canada
* Japan
* France
* Sweden
* United States

## How it works

Streetview images are randomly obtained from a defined radius (0.1 lat and lng) around each country's capital city. 

## Customizing the dataset

You can modify the countries.csv file to include more countries. Each row must include:

* Country name
* Latitude of the country's capital
* Longitude of the country's capital
